# Hello World

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a sample post to demonstrate how markdown files are converted into blog posts.

## Features

- Markdown support
- Code syntax highlighting
- Custom templates
- Automatic blog index generation

Here's a sample code block:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
